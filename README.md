# SATINFO
Satellite System Visualization and Performance Evaluation

[Visualization]
Visualize full constellation satellites and orbits by ephemeris data propagation to predict real-time or custom-time position on 2D/3D Digital Earth and multi-view
Support ECI/ECEF Coordinate System,
Support multi constellation system

[Performance]
System performance visualization, including visibility, coverage, and DOP are calculated and visualize on 2D/3D Digital Earth

[Editor]
System ephemeris data be parsed to a few keplerian parameters which can be edit directly by user for having different constellation system and performance result
